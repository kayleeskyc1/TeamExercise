There I was, walking to the biergarten with my hund, Luna.
On the way to the biergarten. We stopped at the baeckerei for some gebaeck.
I purchased some Brot and Bratwurst for food.
Afterwards, a friend picked us up in their BMW.
Riding in the BMW, making our way to Eltz. 
At the eltz there was a Flughafen and we took a plane to Raesfeld. 
After landing, we started walking down the Hauptstrasse.
There was a man on the street selling some Doesner. I bought some and headed to Berlin.
I tried to hitchhike, but a Porsche just passed me by.
The driver was eating a Gebaeck and a Apfelkuchen while driving.
I was curious if the Klimaanlage in the porsche cooled the pastries down.
